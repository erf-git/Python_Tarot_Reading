# Python_Tarot_Reading

Tarot card reading in google colab using python.
If downloaded make sure to change the "dir" variable to be suitable with your directory.

There are 2 functions in the code:
a) playDefault: regular 3 card spread with only upwards facing cards. Will tell a more detailed fortune.
b) playLightDark: 3 card spread with upwards and upside down facing cards. Will tell a more vague fortune.

Each play function allows for you to read "Past-Present-Future", "Situation-Action-Outcome", or "You-Partner-Relationship" fortunes.
